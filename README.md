Hi Mrs Jones

For this project to actually work all you need to do, is either download the files completely and open it up in VSCode, obviously you need to have all of the dependencies and stuff to run it. 
Then you have start the server in the terminal but simply typing 'npm start' and then enter. 
Then a small pop up window should come up asking if you want to open the port in your browser and click yes. 
Hopefully that all goes smoothly, let me know if theres any issues. 

Regards Chris
